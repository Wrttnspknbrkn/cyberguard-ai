# CyberGuard AI - Cybersecurity Threat Detection Dashboard

Welcome to **CyberGuard AI**, a cutting-edge web application designed to monitor network activity and system logs, detect anomalies, and predict potential cybersecurity threats. This dashboard simulates threat detection with mock data, providing a real-time visualization of the network's security posture.

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**: Simulates the ingestion of network traffic, system event logs, and security tool data for threat analysis.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Utilizes unsupervised learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns and behaviors in network activity.
- **Threat Classification**: Classifies threats into categories such as malware, phishing, DDoS, and more using supervised machine learning.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasts potential future threats using time-series models.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Interactive dashboard with visualizations and metrics to monitor simulated network and security activity.
- **Threat Severity Indicators**: Color-coded icons and indicators that highlight threat severity.
- **Continuous Learning**: Mechanism for model improvement with periodic updates and new threat data.

## üõ† Technologies Used

### **Frontend**
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for sleek and responsive designs.
- **Vite**: A fast, modern build tool for web applications.

### **Backend**
- **Mock Data Simulation**: Simulates real-time threat data and detection algorithms.

### **Development Tools**
- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **Netlify**: For deploying the live web application.

## üîë How It Works

1. **User Interaction**:
   - The user can interact with the dashboard to view real-time data visualizations of network activity and potential threats.

2. **Mock Data Simulation**:
   - The system uses pre-configured simulated data for anomaly detection and predictive analytics.

3. **Threat Detection & Classification**:
   - The AI model analyzes the data to identify potential cybersecurity threats (e.g., malware, DDoS).

4. **Visualization & Reporting**:
   - The detected threats and network metrics are displayed in an interactive, user-friendly dashboard.

üå± Installation
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wrttnspknbrkn/cyberguard-ai.git
cd cyberguard-ai
```
### Install Dependencies
Ensure you have **Node.js** installed. If not, download it [here](https://nodejs.org/).

üåç Deployment
To deploy the app online, we‚Äôre using **Netlify**.
### Steps for Deployment:
1. Go to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2. Click **"New site from Git"** and select your repository (GitHub).
3. Set the build command to `npm run build` and the publish directory to `build/`.
4. Click **Deploy Site**.
Your app will be live on Netlify and accessible to the world!

üí° Ideas for Future Features
- **Threat Intelligence Feeds**: Integrate real-time threat intelligence feeds for more accurate threat detection.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user logins to track and save threat data for multiple users.
- **Interactive Threat Simulation**: Allow users to simulate different types of cyberattacks and view detection results in real-time.
- **Automated Response Actions**: Extend automated response capabilities, such as blocking suspicious IPs or devices.
